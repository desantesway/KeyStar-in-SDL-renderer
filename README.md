# SDL build of Keystar

This is my first experience with SDL using their own engine to render everything, but eventually I realized I needed to do more than SDL could provide, so I decided to port this project into OpenGL as the renderer.  
Having that said, this build won’t have more support (developing in OpenGL now):
